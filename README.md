# WeakSignal
10 random rolls to get the same number twice. 

## Purpose

Small project that tests randomization in series. Improved to show the random rolls being made after signal has been acquired. Project imitates making 10 attempts to send a signal to a ship passing through orbit before it is outside of data acquisition range. Once it is out of range you have failed to send the signal!

### Project Focus:
+ How Randoms work
+ Input data types
+ How to resize Arrays
+ String vs Char Syntax
+ Printing an array

### Future Focus:
+ Shortening code using classes
+ Proper error handling
